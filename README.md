Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our development process, we are introducing a new workflow for our Git repository.

Workflow Summary:

Branching:

For new features or bug fixes, please create a new branch off the develop branch.
Naming convention for branches: feature/your-feature-name or bugfix/issue-number.
Quality Assurance (QA):

Once your changes are ready for testing, merge your feature branch into the qa branch.
Our QA team will review changes on the qa branch.
Pull Requests (PRs):

Create a pull request from your feature branch to qa for testing.
If the QA process is successful, create another pull request from qa to main for the final merge.
Example Workflow:

bash
Copy code
# Create and switch to a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes, commit, and push
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Merge feature branch into qa for testing
git checkout qa
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin qa

# Create PR from feature branch to qa
# (Use your preferred Git platform for this step)

# After successful QA, create PR from qa to main
# (Use your preferred Git platform for this step)
This new workflow will help us maintain a more organized and efficient development process. Please start following this workflow for your future contributions.

If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out. Thank you
